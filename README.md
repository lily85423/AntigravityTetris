    Run main.py and a grid will appear. Click the "how to play" button on the start screen to
    access the instructions, or click anywhere else to begin the game without reading the 
    instructions. On the instructions page, click anywhere to start the game. During gameplay,
    the "x" button will quit the game and take you to the end screen. On the end screen, the "x"
    button will close the window, or click anywhere else to return to the start screen.
